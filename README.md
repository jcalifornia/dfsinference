Inference of bond forces and diffusivities from dynamic force spectoscopy experiment using the method found in the manuscript `[arXiv:1502.06415] <http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06415>`_

This method used a Bayesian interpretation of Tikhonov regularization in order to provide the estimated
bond force, diffusivity, and error estimates of these functions.
